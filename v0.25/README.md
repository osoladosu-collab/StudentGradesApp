# Student Grades App — Version v0.25

This version extends v0.2 by implementing **three separate container types**:

- `std::vector`
- `std::list`
- `std::deque`

The program measures the execution time of:

1. Reading student data from file  
2. Sorting students  
3. Splitting into *passed* and *failed* groups  
4. Writing results to output files  

This allows performance comparison between different C++ container types for large datasets (10K, 100K, 1M, and 10M students).
